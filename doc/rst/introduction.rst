1. Concept
----------

.. ユーザが自分自身で目的に沿ったAIモデルを作れるようにすること.

The concept of ReNomIMG is **ensure that users can create AI models 
according to the purpose by themselves**.

Recent developing deep learning technology realizes extremely big improvement at
recognition accuracy.  

However if you would create a recognition model for any business scene such as 
recognising damages of manufactured products, there are still many problems for 
earning high accuracy recognition model.

For example, correcting training dataset, programming recognition model and train it, 
evaluating the model, and so on.

Especially, even if deep learning era, it is required to tune up the hyper parameters of 
the recognition model. It requires many try and errors.


2. What ReNomIMG provides you.
-------------------------------

ReNomIMG provides you following features.

1. **Building Image Recognition Model without Programming.**
2. **aa**
3. **Using built model from program with tiny code.**
